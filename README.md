# Phaser Webpack Boilerplate
This is a basic Webpack 2.0 template for use with Phaser and ES6/2015.

It is very much a work in progress!!

## Getting Started
You need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/). 

Clone the repository (or download the ZIP file)

`git clone https://github.com/simonma10/phaser-webpack`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Run a development build...

`npm run dev`

Your ES6 code will be transpiled into ES5 and concatenated into a single file.
A sourcemap for your code will also be included (by default `game.map.js`).

Any modification to the files inside the `./src` and `./static` folder will trigger a full page reload.

If you modify the contents of other files, please manually restart the server.
